# Security policy

Oncefold is an experimental pre-1.0 local protocol implementation, not a public
multi-tenant service. Do not use it as the sole safety control for payments,
email, deployment, package publication, destructive infrastructure changes, or
authorization-sensitive merges.

## Supported versions

The current `main` branch and the latest tagged release are supported while
Oncefold remains pre-1.0.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not publish secrets or an exploitable proof in an issue. Use
[GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/Smkzz/Oncefold/security/advisories/new)
for sensitive reports. Do not include sensitive details in a public issue.
Include the affected version or commit, a minimal reproduction, impact, and
whether data could be exposed.

## Security boundaries

- A result digest is not semantic proof and does not grant reuse authority.
- Unknown, malformed, incomplete, stale, revoked, scope-mismatched, and unsafe
  evidence fails closed.
- External mutations are not eligible for automatic exact reuse.
- Trust and authorization scopes are exact opaque values; no wildcard or
  hierarchy is inferred.
- Raw prompts, private reasoning, credentials, secrets, and arbitrary repository
  contents are not protocol requirements.
- Validators are named deterministic contracts; an LLM judgment is not trust
  evidence.

See [`docs/THREAT_MODEL.md`](docs/THREAT_MODEL.md) and
[`docs/LIMITATIONS.md`](docs/LIMITATIONS.md) for the detailed boundary.
